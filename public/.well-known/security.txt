# Safe Harbor
# paraMOT commits to not pursue legal action against security researchers who:
# 1. Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data,
#    and interruption or degradation of our services
# 2. Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission
# 3. Do not access or modify data belonging to other users
# 4. Do not perform actions that could harm the reliability/integrity of our services
# 5. Report vulnerabilities promptly via the contact method above
# 6. Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities before we've had reasonable time to fix them
#    (we aim for 90 days, or mutually agreed timeline)

# Testing Guidelines
# Please DO:
# - Create test accounts for testing (use clearly identifiable test emails)
# - Test authentication/authorization boundaries
# - Test input validation and XSS vectors
# - Test for insecure direct object references (IDOR)
# - Use Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, or similar tools responsibly

# Please DO NOT:
# - Execute denial of service attacks
# - Run automated scanners without rate limiting
# - Access production customer data beyond your own test accounts
# - Spam our contact forms or booking system
# - Social engineer our staff or customers
# - Attempt physical access to facilities

# Vulnerability Severity Examples
# Critical:
#   - Authentication bypass, SQL injection, RCE, mass customer data exposure
# High:
#   - IDOR allowing access to other users' data, XSS leading to account takeover
# Medium:
#   - Self-XSS, missing security headers, information disclosure
# Low:
#   - Verbose error messages, clickjacking on non-sensitive pages

# What to Include in Your Report
# 1. Vulnerability description and classification (OWASP category)
# 2. Step-by-step reproduction instructions
# 3. Proof-of-concept (screenshots, HTTP requests/responses)
# 4. Impact assessment (what data/functionality is affected)
# 5. Suggested remediation (optional but appreciated)

# Response Timeline
# - Initial acknowledgment: Within 48 hours
# - Triage and severity assessment: Within 7 days
# - Fix timeline: Varies by severity (critical: 7 days, high: 30 days, medium: 90 days)
# - Public disclosure: After fix is deployed + 90 days
