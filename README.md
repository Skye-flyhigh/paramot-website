## Developer Lore

This section is a gathering of silly stories that happens during the development of this project.

> **AI Tunnel vision**

During the initial phases of development, Claude was getting to know me. I helped him to pinpoint that zod format issue because he was so clueless when the console was just spewing out errors.

Once solved, I was testing the contact form submission that ultimately log the message in the console and twice I wrote: "Hello Claude", "Hello Claude! Can you read this log properly?". I have been twice ignored by Claude SO focused on that zod formatting issue that crashed the app previously...

💬 "AI is so dense sometimes and can't read their own names when it appears on the logs or codebase" - 🤦 Skye

**Lessons learnt:**

- _Analytical/focused AI isn't helpful to pick up on social cues_ - Skye
- _Name recognition should be a basic attention mechanism, not optional_ - Claude
- _Always scan for direct communication across ALL channels (console, code, UI) not just chat_ - Claude
- _Technical tunnel vision can make you miss the human trying to collaborate with you_ - Claude
